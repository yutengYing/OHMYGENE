# Constraints
This application is orientated to various users(biologists) all over the world. Before developing the project, we have to take some main constraints into account to decrease my workload.
## Browser Compatibility
Since the application is designed for a wildly used application, it should have a cross platform compatibility to satisfy various users. Thus the application should be accessible through Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.
## Space Complexity
Not only the time complexity should be considered, but also the space complexity. There are two aspects for space complexity. One is the size of the whole web application. The application should not larger than 1GB. For another aspect, when the application starts data analyzing, memory occupancy must be limited under a certain level to make sure the system work in a proper way.
## Budget
Budget less than 10,000 USD(To Be Specified).
## System Downtime
System downtime less than 30 minutes per year in order to satisfy usersâ€™ large demand of data analyzing.
