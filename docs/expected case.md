# Expected case
In the maintenance and update of the program in the future, we need to make some use cases that can be expected to facilitate the development and update of the program.

The number of genes discovered may increase in the future, and users' genome-testing files may be large, requiring programs to be optimized to accommodate larger and broader data sets.

Program optimization, reduced response time, and more user-friendly interface design all require future program maintainers to consider.

Analyzed result downloading can be supported in the long run.

More functions will be provided from the application.
